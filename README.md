# Blogs in ML Paradigm

This repository is for listing blogs on different business or technical problems that can be solved by AI/ML from companies that are working in AI/ML. This will help you design AI/ML systems of your own and can help with interview preparation.

If you want to add any new category or business problem that AI/ML can solve and you want it to be included in this, please reach out to me.
